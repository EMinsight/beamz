BEAMZ is an **electromagnetic simulation and inverse / generative design** package with support for multiple backends. It features a **high-level API** that enables fast prototyping and  design with just a few lines of code, ideal for engineers. For researchers, BEAMZ also exposes low-level functionality, making it a flexible playground for developing and testing novel simulation and optimization methods.
