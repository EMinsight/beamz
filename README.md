BeamZ is a GPU-accelerated multi-backend EM-simulation and optimization framework. Its high-level API allows for most simulations and designs to be created in just a few lines of code, ideal for engineering, while access to low-level functionality makes BeamZ a playground to develop new research ideas.

```bash
pip install beamz
```
