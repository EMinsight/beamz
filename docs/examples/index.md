# Tutorials
To get you started quickly, below are a few very simple examples with less than 50 lines of code!

1. [Basic Dipole Simulation](dipole.md) - Create a simple dipole simulation.
2. [Waveguide Simulation](waveguide.md) - Couple light into a waveguide.
3. [Ring Resonator](ring-resonator.md) - Let light resonate within a SiN ring.
4. [MMI Coupler](mmi-coupler.md) - Make a 1x2 MMI 50/50 power splitter.

Alternatively, I encourage you to go to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuentinWach/beamz) and simply browse through the examples directory and copy/paste the code to run locally.

Before starting the tutorials, make sure you have BEAMZ installed (see [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md))

And please, if you encounter any issues while following the tutorials, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/QuentinWach/beamz) amd open an issue!
